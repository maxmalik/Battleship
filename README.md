# Battleship

This project was Exam 2 of my Intro to C class in Spring 2022 at Valencia College. 

It utilizes many basic C operations, such as function calls, variable references, structs, loops, 2D arrays, input validation, and data saving. 


How the game works:

5 ships of varying lengths and orientations (horizontal/vertical) are scattered throughout a 10x10 board organized by letters then numbers. Each round, the user fires a missle at a specific space on the board (ex. input G4). If part of a ship is there, it is a hit. If not, it is a miss. If a user chooses to quit (input QQ), the data is saved for the next time the user runs the game. When a user hits all of a ship's spaces, it is sunk. When all ships are sunk, the user wins!
